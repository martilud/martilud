My name is Martin Ludvigsen. I am a PhD student at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at NTNU. 

My main interests are optimization, machine learning and statistical learning. My main research interests are inverse problems and source separation problems.

I program almost exclusively in Python, with the help of NumPy and Pytorch.
